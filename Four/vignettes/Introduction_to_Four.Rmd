# Overview

The `Four` package provides a linear regression function `linreg` for performing multiple regression models. The package also implements several methods for `linreg` objects, such as `print()`, `summary()`, and `plot()`. This document will introduce how to use the package and show how to apply these methods on the `iris` dataset.

# Install and Load Packages

First, make sure you have the package installed and loaded:

```r
# Uncomment the line below to install the package if you haven't done so
# devtools::install_github("your-username/Four")
library(Four)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
